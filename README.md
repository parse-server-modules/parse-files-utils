Utilities to list and ~~migrate~~ Parse files.

**File migration is not available anymore as the hosted Parse service has now shut down**

This utility will do the following:

1. Get all files across all classes in a Parse database.
2. Print file URLs to console OR transfer to S3, GCS, or filesystem.
3. Rename files so that [Parse Server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) no longer detects that they are hosted by Parse.
4. Update MongoDB with new file names.

#### \*WARNING\*
As soon as this script transfers files away from Parse.com hosted files (and renames them in the database) 
any clients that use api.parse.com will no longer be able to access the files. 
See the section titled "5. Files" in the [Parse Migration Guide](https://parse.com/migration) 
and Parse Server [issue #1582](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/issues/1582).

## Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:parse-server-modules/parse-files-utils.git`
2. cd into repo: `cd parse-files-utils`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

The quickest way to get started is to run `npm start` and follow the command prompts.

You can optionally specify a js/json configuration file (see [config.example.js](./config.example.js)).
```
$ npm start config.js
```

### Available configuration options

* `applicationId`: Parse application id.
* `masterKey`: Parse master key.
* `serverURL`: The URL for the Parse server (default: http://api.parse.com/1). 
This is used to with `applicationId` and `masterKey` to get the schema and fetch all files/objects.
* `renameFiles` (boolean): Whether or not to rename Parse hosted files. 
This removes the "tfss-" or legacy Parse filename prefix before saving with the new file adapter.
* `renameInDatabase` (boolean): Whether or not to rename files in MongoDB.
* `mongoURL`: MongoDB connection url. 
Direct access to the database is needed because Parse SDK doesn't allow direct writing to file fields.
* `filesToTransfer`: Which files to transfer. 
Accepted options:
  * `"parseOnly"`: only process files with a filename that starts with "tfss-" or matches Parse's legacy file name format.
  * `"parseServerOnly"`: only process files with a filename that **does not** start with "tfss-" nor match Parse's legacy file name format.
  * `"all"`: process all files.
* `filesAdapter`: A Parse Server file adapter with a function for `createFile(filename, data)`  
(ie. [parse-server-fs-adapter](https://github.com/parse-server-modules/parse-server-fs-adapter),
[parse-server-s3-adapter](https://github.com/parse-server-modules/parse-server-s3-adapter),
[parse-server-gcs-adapter](https://github.com/parse-server-modules/parse-server-gcs-adapter)).
* `filesystemPath`: The path/directory to save files to when transfering to filesystem.
* `aws_accessKeyId`: AWS access key id.
* `aws_secretAccessKey`: AWS secret access key.
* `aws_bucket`: S3 bucket name.
* `gcs_projectId`: GCS project id.
* `gcs_keyFilename`: GCS key filename (ie. `credentials.json`).
* `gcs_bucket`: GCS bucket name.
* `asyncLimit`: The number of files to process at the same time (default: 5).


## Parse File Migrations

If you need to migrate files from hosted Parse.com to self-hosted Parse Server,
you should follow one of the below strategies. 
Given [ParsePlatform/parse-server#1582](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/issues/1582), 
there will not be any updates to api.parse.com. This leaves two options for the file migration. 
Each one has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

**Option 1**: 
"Supporting clients that access via api.parse.com is *not* important"
* File utils configuration:
  * `filesToTransfer`: 'parseOnly'
  * `renameFiles`: true
  * `renameInDatabase`: true
* Parse Server configuration: keep using `fileKey` in settings
* After file migration:
  * api.parse.com clients:
    * can not see all previously uploaded files
    * can not see files uploaded by Parse Server clients
    * can see new files uploaded by api.parse.com clients
  * Parse Server clients:
    * can see all previously uploaded files
    * can see new files uploaded by api.parse.com clients
    * can see new files uploaded by Parse Server clients
* Additional steps required:
  * Run file migration again after all clients switch to Parse Server or before Jan 28

**Option 2**: 
"Supporting clients that access via api.parse.com is important"
* File utils configuration:
  * `filesToTransfer`: 'parseOnly'
  * `renameFiles`: false
  * `renameInDatabase`: false
* Parse Server configuration: 
  * Use version >= 2.2.16
  * remove `fileKey` from settings 
* After file migration:
  * api.parse.com clients:
    * can see all previously uploaded files
    * can not see files uploaded by Parse Server clients
  * Parse Server clients:
    * can see all migrated files
    * can not see new files uploaded by api.parse.com clients
* Additional steps required:
  * Run file migration again after all clients switch to Parse Server or before Jan 28
